# The GroupMe Word Counter

Running on Python 3, The GroupMe Word Counter is a simple script I have written to count every word posted within the last 100 messages of a specific group.
It keeps a record of the word count used by each user of the group, and prints the count to the group. Words in the 100 most common english words (retrieved from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Most_common_words_in_English)
are filtered out of the record.

The script was originally written to humor a friend of mine.
